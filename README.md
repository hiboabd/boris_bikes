Boris_Bikes  

Boris_Bikes has not yet been invented.  Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, has come to you with a plan: To create a network of docking stations and bikes around London that anyone can use.  They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.  Coding will be in Ruby.  ###Reminder of weekly goals:### By the end of the week all developers can:  -Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods -Pair using the driver-navigator style -Follow an effective debugging process -Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
